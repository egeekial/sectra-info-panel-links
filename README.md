A lightweight web page that surfaces frequently used Radiology resources (protocol libraries, on-call schedules, incident reporting, etc.) directly inside the **Info Panel** of Sectra PACSâ€”or any other system that can embed an HTML page.

* **BootstrapÂ 5** for layout and quick responsiveness
* **BootstrapÂ Icons** & **Lucide Icons** for a clean, modern look
* **Collapsible divisions** so radiologists can drill down to subspecialty resources without clutter

## Customizing the Links

1. Open **`index.html`** in your favorite editor.
2. Replace each `https://example.com/...` placeholder with your institutionâ€™s real links.
3. Optionally remove or duplicate list items/divisions to match your workflow.
4. Save and refreshâ€”no build step required.

## Linkâ€‘Request Form (`link-request.html`)

> **Important ðŸ“ŒÂ `link-request.html` is only a frontâ€‘end form stub.** You must add your own backend (email handler, ticketing endpoint, or serverless function) and set the formâ€™s `action` attribute accordingly. Out of the box, the page does **not** send data anywhere.

## Icon Usage

### Bootstrap Icons

Bootstrap Icons are included via CDN:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap-icons@1.11.1/font/bootstrap-icons.css">
```

Insert an icon:

```html
<i class="bi bi-calendar3"></i>
```

Browse the full catalog at [https://icons.getbootstrap.com](https://icons.getbootstrap.com).

### Lucide Icons

Lucide provides a large selection of outlineâ€‘style icons and is loaded via CDN:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest"></script>
```

Add icons in markup using the `data-lucide` attribute, optionally with a helper class for sizing:

```html
<i data-lucide="atom" class="lucide-icon me-1"></i>
```

At runtime, `sectra.js` runs:

```js
lucide.createIcons();
```

which converts every `data-lucide` element into an inline SVG. Full list: [https://lucide.dev](https://lucide.dev).

## Styling

* **`sectra.css`** contains **color** tokens tailored for darkâ€‘mode interfaces (deep navy background, light text) but can be themed to match your brand.
* Bootstrap utility classes (e.g., `pt-2`, `text-light`) let you tweak layout quickly.
